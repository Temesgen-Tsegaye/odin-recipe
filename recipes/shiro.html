        <h1>Shiro recipe</h1>

        <h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
        <p>for anyone who is unfamiliar, Shiro is a staple vegetarian dish (actually it’s vegetarian
           AND gluten free!) in Ethiopian cuisine. It’s basically a stew or curry made from ground dried
            chickpeas and various spices.  The chickpeas give the stew a beautiful texture and nutty flavor.
            It’s very smooth and spreadable, almost the consistency of a thickened pureed soup.
              Just mix and stir! </p>
              
              <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup of oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cheackpea flour</li>
                <li>2 medium onions pureed</li>
                <li>1 roma tomato</li>
                <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>2 cups of water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon of berbere spice</li>
                <li>1 teasppon garlic powder</li>
                <li>salt</li>
        
                
              </ul>
              <h2>INSTURACTION</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the dry pan,
                     and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 4-5 minutes.
                    Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to add
                    about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 1
                    cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining ½ cup of water
                    if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.
                </li>
                <li>Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic 
                    powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.
                </li>
                <li>Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil
                     separates slightly from the shiro.
                </li>
                <li>Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.

                </li>
                <li>Serve with fresh injera.</li>
              </ol>
