            <li>200g cornmeal powder</li>
            <li>100g raw okra diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegtable oil</li>
            <li>600ml water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Add the parsley, celery, spring onion, onion, ginger, 4 sprigs
            of fresh thyme, red chilli and lime juice to a food processor
            and pulse several times to give a coarse green marinade.
            Put the fish fillets in a bowl, then pour in the mixture. Turn
            and brush the fish well to make sure it's completely covered by
            the marinade. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for at 

            <li>To make the sauce, heat the oil in a large pan and add the
                onions and peppers. Cook for about 5 minutes on medium
                heat until they have started to soften and turn golden. Then
                add the remaining 2 sprigs of thyme and the scotch bonnet
                (if using), and cook for 1 more minute. Add the marinated
                fish, tomatoes and salt, gently stir and spoon the sauce over
                the fish. Turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and simmer
                for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the fish is cooking, make the cou cou. Add the
                cornmeal to a mixing bowl and slowly add just enough cold
                water to cover it. Use a wooden spoon to mix to a smooth
                paste, with no dry lumps visible. Set this cornmeal paste
                aside.</li>
            <li>ut the diced okra in a pot with about 400ml of water. Bring
                to a medium boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer
                for about 5 minutes until the okra softens. Use a sieve or
                colander to drain the okra, making sure to keep the hot okra
                water. Put the okra aside, then pour about a quarter of the
                hot okra water back into the pan and the rest into a jug.
                    </li>
            <li>With the heat on low, gradually add a quarter of the
                soaked cornmeal mixture to the okra water in the pot, and
                whisk to a smooth paste. Add the oil to the mixture and whisk
                well, before gradually adding the rest of the okra water and
                cornmeal. Whisk continuously until all the cornmeal and
                liquid is well mixed and smooth.</li>
            <li>Switch to a wooden spoon and keep mixing the cornmeal
                for another 2 or 3 minutes. It will start to bubble and thicken,
                so will need mixing harder to avoid lumps. At this point add
                the cooked okra and mix for another few minutes, or until the
                okra is well incorporated though the cornmeal, and then
                remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Scatter the chopped parsley over the fish, and serve with 
                the cou cou</li>
